# Quick start

Open R and install the gslea package and try some commands outlined in ?gslea:

```{r quickstart, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("duplisea/gslea", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(gslea)
?gslea
```

# Purpose
This describes the building of, the structure of and the use of an R package that gathers up physical, chemical, planktonic, plankton phenological and fish survey data into one place. This is a standalone R package that can be called from scripts or other packages for use. The data are provided spatially by the GSL ecoregions determined in Quebec Region in Spring 2019 (Fig. 1).

The package has been developed to allow for easy and consistent updating via automated scripts from tables provides by several individuals. This means that people should not have to keep pestering say Peter or Marjolaine to fullfill specific data requests for them. The package has a very simple data table structure with a minimal set of functions to understand the structure, query data and plot data roughly for initial data exploration. Data can then be brought into various analyses for the GSL that may fall under the banner of an ecosystem approach.

# Data coverage
Presently, this package consists of data for the Gulf of St Lawrence where collection and management of the data is done out of the Quebec Region. This means that physical, chemical and phenological data generally cover the entire Gulf of St Lawrence but fish survey data (not in the database yet) cover only the northern portion as the southern portion of the Gulf is surveyed by the Gulf Region in Moncton and with a different survey gear.

# Design
The package is GPL-3 licenced and thus is available globally without warranty. The package is designed to have as few data containers as possible and in a common and consistent format to allow generic extraction. The package has only one dependence which is the library data.table and data.table itself has no dependencies. The data.table library is used because of its efficient use of computing resources making it very fast for processing data (https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/) which is important if in someone’s analysis they make repeated queries to the data in loops or in bootstrapping directly from the full database. The data are structured in what has become termed “tidy data” for people in the tidyverse as opposed to dirty data I suppose. You can use your own tidyverse code on it. The data class "data.table" inherit a secondary class of data.frame, therefore they are compatible with all the base R data.frame operations. The package is designed such that it is consistent, should be scalable to when new data types become available and should not break existing analyses when updated (I hope).

# Components of gslea

## Data objects
The package consists of three tables presently:

<ins>EA.data</ins> This is where all the measurements reside. The data.table (inherits data.frame as second choice) has four columns: <b>year</b>, <b>EAR</b>, <b>variable</b>, <b>value</b>. Where year is the year (integer) of data collection, <b>EAR</b> is the ecosystem approach region (see fig 1) (character), <b>variable</b> is the name of the variable (character), <b>value</b> is the measured values (numeric). <b>variable</b> is set as the key variable

<ins>variable.descriptions</ins> this provides a description of the variable in EA.data. This table contains five columns: <b>variable</b> is the name of the variable (character), <b>description</b> is a description of the variable and what is represents, <b>units</b> are the units of measure of the variable, <b>contact</b> is the name of the contact person who provided the data, <b>type</b> is the type of data (“physical”, “chemical”, “planktonic”, “phenological”, “fish”), <b>extraction.date</b> is the date which the contact person extracted the data from their database. <b>variable</b> is the key variable.
Some of the variables are not just single measures per year but monthly measures. It was a conscious decision not to make a sub-year time column in these cases which makes the extraction result more difficult since often people want data in two-dimensional tabular format. So for example some of the plankton data are available by month. In these cases, there is a separate variable for each month and if it were for September it would end in ...month9.

<ins>field.descriptions</ins> this gives a description of the field names in the EA.data especially as these might need elaboration in some cases. The table contains three columns: <b>field</b> which is the field name in the EA.data table, <b>description</b> which describes what is represented by that column, <b>elaboration</b> which provides more details on the column when needed. So the elaboration column for <b>EAR</b> describes the areas represented by each ecoregion code. Elaboration for variable describes specifically what is meant by a variable containing a name that may include “early summer”. <b>field</b> is the key variable.

## Functions

The package consists of just four functions:

<ins>metadata.f(verbosity)</ins> a description of the data available with three levels of <b>verbosity</b> ("low" "med", "high") or information on everyone's favourite Dutch post-impressionist (lowercase no spaces).

<ins>vars.f(variable.type)</ins> shows the variables available in a particular <b>variable.type</b> ("physical", "chemical", "planktonic", "phenologic"), gives a description of each and its units.

<ins>EA.query.f(variables, years, EARs) </ins> the function you use to query the data and the output is in long data format. <b>variables</b> (e.g. "T150","SST") is a character vector, <b>years</b> is a numeric vector (e.g. 2002:2012), <b>EARs</b> is the ecoregion and is a numeric vector (e.g. 1:3).

<ins>EA.plot.f(variables, years, EARs, ...)</ins> this will plot the variables over time. It will make a matrix of variable x EAR with up to 25 plots per page (i.e. 25 variable*EAR combinations). <b>variables</b> (e.g. "T150") is a character vector, <b>years</b> is a numeric vector (e.g. 2002:2012), <b>EARs</b> is the ecoregion and is a numeric vector (e.g. 1:3), <b>smoothing</b> is a logical on whether the smooth.spline should be run through the data series to help give a general idea of the tendencies in time. It will only try to smooth if the data has more than 5 observations. <b>....</b> will accept parameters to par for plotting. This is mostly for quick exploration of the data rather than for making good quality graphics.

# Installing gslea

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("duplisea/gslea", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(gslea)
```

```{r ldlib, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
library(gslea)
```

# Accessing the data
## Data content overviews
A few minimal extraction functions are provided that should be fast and relatively generic. A function called <b>metadata.f</b> is provided with three levels of verbosity to give you an overview. “low” verbosity just gives a few stats on the size of the database and the number of variables and EARs. “med” verbosity will give you names of variables and units. “high” is not that useful because it pretty well outputs the entire content of the variable.description table.

```{r metadata, eval=TRUE}
metadata.f(verbosity="low")
```

Another perhaps more useful way to know what the database contains is with the function <b>var.f</b>. <b>var.f</b> accepts as an argument one of the data types with the default being “all”. The options are the adjectives for a data type: "physical", "chemical", "planktonic", "phenological" which for some data types seems awkward but it is consistent. It will give you the exact name of the variable, its description and units. The output can be long and the descriptions are sometimes quite wordy so it is difficult to read. I suggest you save the result of a large query to var.f as an object and then use the library formattable to make it into a more readable table. So for example formattable, e.g.:

```{r variables, eval=TRUE}
phys.var= vars.f(variable.type="physical")
formattable::formattable(phys.var)
```

## Data extraction
Extracting the data is done with a single function called <b>EA.query.f</b>. This query wants a character vector or scalar for variable, an integer vector or scalar for year and an integer vector or scalar for EAR:

```{r extraction1, eval=TRUE}
EA.query.f(years=1999:2012, variables=c("T150", "ph_bot.fall", "T250"), EARs=1:2)
```

You need to name all the variables you want to extract but you can access all the years or all the EARs by putting a wide range on them:

```{r extraction2, eval=TRUE}
EA.query.f(years=1900:2020, variables=c("T150", "ph_bot.fall", "T250"), EARs=1:99)
```

You may want to save the results of a query to an object and then export it to csv (<b>fwrite</b>) or some other format.


### Recasting data and showing when there were no observations
The data are in long format (tidyverse speak = "tidy data") which is the common way to store data in databases. It means that for a variable x year x EAR comination where there is no observation, there is not a row in the database either. If you want tabular data (wide) to show when say and observation was not made for a particular year and variable and EAR, then you can widen the data using the "dcast" function from data.table

```{r recasting, eval=TRUE}
dat= EA.query.f(years=1900:2020, variables=c("T150","ph_bot.fall","ice.max","O2.Late_summer.sat.mean50_100"), EARs=1)
dcast(dat, year~ variable)
```

This puts each variable as a separate column, it preserves all the years where at least one of the variables had an observation and it puts NA for variable x year combinations where there was no observation.

It is important to know that when you do this as above, you are making 2-dimensional table data which is fine if your data are two dimensional. If you have more than one EAR, then your initial data are 3-dimensional and when you cast the data to 2-dimensions, a decision needs to made on how to reduce it to 2-dimensions. This is done with a "group by" function. By default, dcast will do a group-by as count but you can also specify other groub-by functions such as sum or mean. You can also, however, cast data into 2-dimensions but it will repeat the columns for each EAR (note that "EAR" is now in the right hand side of the formula)

```{r recasting2, eval=TRUE}
dat= EA.query.f(years=2015:2020, variables=c("T150","ph_bot.fall","ice.max","O2.Late_summer.sat.mean50_100"), EARs=1:100)
dcast(dat, year~ variable+EAR)
```
This wide data now has as many rows as years and as many columns as variable x EAR. The columns are named with the variable followed by "_EAR" to identify the EAR it represents.

## Data plotting
The data plotting function <b>EA.plot.f</b> just queries the EA.data with <b>EA.query.f</b> and then plots them. It puts all the plots on one page as a matrix of plots with each row being a variable and each column being an EAR:

```{r plotting1, eval=TRUE}
EA.plot.f(years=1900:2020, variables=c("T150", "ph_bot.fall", "T250"), EARs=1:4, smoothing=T)
```

It will plot a maximum of 25 plots per page. What you might want to do is call pdf("EA.plots.pdf") xxx dev.off() when doing this and it will put them all in one pdf in your working directory.

Another example of the plot without smoothing and different graphical parameters:

```{r plotting2, eval=TRUE}
EA.plot.f(years=1900:2020, variables=c("T150", "ph_bot.fall", "T250"), EARs=1:4, smoothing=F, pch=20, lwd=2, col="blue", type="b")
```

You can see that if there are no data for the variable by EAR combination, a blank plot is produced in the plot matrix.

You may want to plot all variables of a particular type. You can do this by selecting the variables with the vars.f function and selecting just the <b>variable</b> column from its output using "$"
```{r plotting3, eval=TRUE}
EA.plot.f(years=1900:2020, variables=vars.f(variable.type="phenological")$variable, EARs=1:2, smoothing=T)
```

# Updating the package
<mark>Unless you need to update this database, you do not need to read this</mark>

It is important that the database can be updated consistently and quickly. This is done through a series of system calls to bash while running R in linux using text processing programs like awk and sed and then manipulation in R.

To update the package you will need the standard packages for doing it like roxygen and devtools.

## Computing requirements for updating

This package requires linux to update. The reason linux is needed is because it uses BASH system calls and programs like awk and sed to pre-process data to make names consisitent, e.g. “Year” to “year” or other inconsistencies between how raw data is provided by different people. If data gets provided by people differently between updates then this will require updating of these scripts.

Once the data are processed and brought into the R package, then it should be useable by any platform that runs R but I would not know how to process the raw data in windows. You may be able to do this in windows10 powershell but I have never tried it so I cannot say it will work. I do note that powershell does not have "sed" installed by default and you cannot run R from powershell so I am not sure you could send R systemcalls to the powershell and if you can the script will fail without "sed".

## Raw data
Raw data has been provided in various forms by individual data providers. Sometimes it is in tabular format while other times it is in a long format. We need to turn it all into long format and this also involves standardising variable names.

## Running the update script
The update script is XXXX which is run from R. It makes system calls to the working directory you set. That working directory can be anywhere on your machine and you need to make sure there are sub-directories of that which are named by the data provider. So Peter Galbraith has supplied the physical oceanographic data and therefore the subdirectory is called galbraith. His raw .dat files are located there. These are text files of a sort that Peter extracts with commented (#) header lines describing the data and finishing with the data itself. Marjolaine Blais has supplied the chemical, planktonic and phenological variables is various forms. The subdirectory blais also has subdirectories for zooplankton, oxygen, pH etc.
Aside from the data itself, the two other tables need to be imported into R. These sheets in an excel file describing the data. At first I was pulling this information from the headers but there were a lot of differences and this was creating very one-off fragile scripts that I knew would likely break on each update. Therefore, the excel sheets have been created to keep this information. You will need to edit them in excel. The good thing is that all you will have to alter for a simple update is the extraction date.  If you add new variables though, you will need to add a new line with all the information about that variable.

If this is all in order on your machine, you just need to run the update script in the R command line. The script will manipulate the data and save each data.table as an .rda file in your data directory for the R package.

I doubt it will go this smoothly but I hope so.

## Updating the R package

### Compiling documentation
If you changed the documentation for the datasets or functions, you need to recompile the documentation using roxygen2.

### Making the R package
Clean and rebuild
